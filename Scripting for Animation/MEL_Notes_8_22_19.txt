Common Variables
	-float
	-int
	-string
	-array

EX.

string $name;
$name = "Ryley";

	//all variables have to start with "$"
	//all lines end with ";"
	//once the line has been defined as a string, it stays a string unless you start
	your code with an open/close curly brackets.

ARRAY
//to set up an array you have to add "[]" following the datatype

EX.

string $ages[]; 
$ages[0] = "Tyler";
$ages[1] = "Jesse";
$ages[2] = "Pam";
print $ages; 

	//once the "[]" have been defined, you don't need to rewrite it.
